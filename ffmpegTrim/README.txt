!!! FFMPEG IS REQUIRED FOR THIS TO WORK AND IS NOT INCLUDED WITH THIS (for now) !!!
Drop the ffmpeg.exe in the same folder as the script, it should work fine; unless you're smart and have it added to your PATH environment.

ffmpeg can be downloaded here: https://ffmpeg.org/

You can drag and drop the video file onto the window of the script to drop the filepath in easily.

Timecode format for start and end times are hh:mm:ss
